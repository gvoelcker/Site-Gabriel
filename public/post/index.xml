      <description>My name is Gabriel Voelcker and I am, among other things, an economist. I hope to use this netlify as a place to formalize my ideas, improve my coding skills and, last but not least, connect with other people who share interests with me.</description>

      <description>I am an economist from Brazil. My alma mater is Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, and I graduated in 2016. I am currently finishing my masters in Accounting at Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos. My main research interests include: econometrics, microeconomics, disclosure, disclosure regulation, game theory, risk, behavioural economics, decision-making, cultural economics and dividend policy.
You can find everything I have published in my Google Scholar page, although I havenâ€™t many contributions yet.</description>
