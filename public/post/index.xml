      <description>My name is Gabriel Voelcker and I am, among other things, an economist. I hope to use this netlify as a place to formalize my ideas, improve my coding skills and, last but not least, connect with other people who share interests with me.
In case you are wondering, the above picture is from Vienna, Austria.</description>

      <description>I am an economist from Brazil. My alma mater is Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, and I graduated in 2016. I am currently finishing my masters in Accounting in Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos. My main research interests include: econometrics, microeconomics, game theory, risk, behavioural economics, decision-making, cultural economics and dividend policy.
You can find everything I have published in my Google Scholar page. I also have worked as a research assistant in three distinct research projects: 1, a second one which hasnâ€™t been published yet and 3.</description>
