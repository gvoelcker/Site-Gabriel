## **1st Lecture: Utility and Revealed Preferences**

Summary

### Utility Theory

#### [**Utility Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility): 

In most economic models, agents are assumed to have a utility function that they maximize. The utility function approach usually serves two purposes:

1) Model for predicting behavior (positive); i.e. agent will maximize utility.
    
2) Framework for welfare analysis (normative); i.e. utility is "good".
    
#### [**Axiomatic Approach**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system): 

Any set of axioms from which some or all axioms can be used in conjunction to logically derive theorems exemplify an axiomatic approach. A theory consists of an axiomatic system and all its derived theorems. An axiomatic system that is completely described is a special kind of formal system. A formal theory typically means an axiomatic system, for example formulated within model theory. A formal proof is a complete rendition of a mathematical proof within a formal system.

#### [**Utility Function**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility#Utility_function): 

Consider a set of alternatives facing an individual, and over which the individual has a preference ordering. A **utility function** is able to represent those preferences if it is possible to assign a real number to each alternative, in such a way that alternative a is assigned a number greater than alternative b if, and only if, the individual prefers alternative a to alternative b. In this situation an individual that selects the most preferred alternative available is necessarily also selecting the alternative that maximises the associated utility function. In general economic terms, a utility function measures preferences concerning a set of goods and services. Often, utility is correlated with words such as happiness, satisfaction, and welfare, and these are hard to measure mathematically. Thus, economists utilize consumption baskets of preferences in order to measure these abstract, non quantifiable ideas. 

Gérard Debreu precisely defined the conditions required for a preference ordering to be representable by a utility function. For a finite set of alternatives these require only that the preference ordering is complete (so the individual is able to determine which of any two alternatives is preferred, or that they are equally preferred), and that the preference order is transitive.

##### **Utility Function Definition**: 

A u defined on X is a real-valued function u: X -> $\mathbb{R}$. A more foundational place to start to think about assumptions inherent in utility theory is treating preferences as a primitive.

##### **Preference Definition**: 

*P* is a subset of X x X, where we write x $\succeq_P$ *y* if (x,y) $\in$ *P*. Interpretation of x $\succeq_P$ y: agent thinks "*x* is at least as good as *y*".

So the utility function *u*: X -> $\mathbb{R}$ **represents** the preference P if:

  u(x) ≥ u(y) $\iff$ x $\succeq_P$ y.

Note: many different utility functions can represent the same set of
preferences. e.g., if X = {x, y, z}, and P = {(x, y),(x, z),(y, z)}
(i.e x $\succeq_P$ y, x $\succeq_P$ z, y $\succeq_P$ z).

In general if u represents P, then so does *f* $\circ$ *u*, for any *strictly* increasing function *f*.

##### **Properties of Preferences**:

- The preference relation $\succeq_P$ is **complete** on *X* if $\forall$*x*, *y* $\in$ *X*, either *x* $\succeq_P$ *y* or *y* $\succeq_P$ *x*.

- The preference relation $\succeq_P$ is **reflexive** on *X* if $\forall$*x* $\in$ *X*, *x* $\succeq_P$ *x*.

- The preference relation $\succeq_P$ is **transitive** on *X* if *x* $\succeq_P$ *y* and *y* $\succeq_P$ *z* $\implies$ *x* $\succeq_P$ *z*.

##### **Proposition**:

If $\succeq_P$ is represented by *u* on *X*, then $\succeq_P$ is complete, reflexive and transitive.

**Proof**:

- Complete: given any *x,y* $\in$ *X*, either u(x) ≥ u(y) or u(y) ≥ u(x) (property of real numbers). This implies x $\succeq_P$ y or y $\succeq_P$ x(by representation assumption).

- Reflexive: given any x $\in$ X, u(x) ≥ u(x) $\implies$ x $\succeq_P$ x.

- Transitive: if x $\succeq_P$ y and y $\succeq_P$ z, then u(x) ≥ u(y) and u(y) ≥ u(z). Transitivity of ≥ on $\mathbb{R}$ implies that u(x) ≥ u(z) $\implies$ x $\succeq_P$ z.

Some comments:

1) With finite sets, apparently assuming utility maximization is exactly the same as assuming preferences are complete, reflexive and transitive.

2) Any critique of utility theory is a critique of one of these assumptions (or our notion of preferences). If we are happy with these, then we are happy with utility functions.
