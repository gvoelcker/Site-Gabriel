### **L1** 

#### **Static Deterministic Choice and Revealed Preference**

- **Completeness**: for every set of alternatives(menus) X: agents know whether they prefer *x* or *y*. 

- **Transitive**: given *x*, *y* and *z*, if $x \succeq y$ and $y \succeq z$, then $x \succeq z$.

- **Anti-symmetric**: if $x \succeq y$ and $y \succeq x$, then *x* = *y*. 
- **Choice correspondence**: a map c:M(X) $\rightarrow$ M(X) s.t. c(A) $\subseteq) A. c(A) gives the alternatives chosen when presented with menu A.

- **WARP**: if A,B $\in M$ and *x,y* $\in$ A $\cap$ B, $x \in C(A)$ and $y \in C(B)$ $\implies x \in C(B)$. In words, this means: 

    - WARP: implies Sen's $\alpha$: if $x \in A \subseteq B$ and $x \in C(B)$ $\implies$ $x \in C(A)$. 
    
    - **Weakly revealed preferred**: $\succeq^\ast$. If x $\succeq^\ast$ y $\implies$ x was chosen for any menu that contains *y*. 
    
- **Transitive closure**: when you can add terms between the relation x $\succeq^\ast$ y $\implies$ x $\succeq^\ast$ z $\succeq^\ast$ y.

- **Congruent**: if x $\succeq^\ast$ y and y $\in$ C(A) then x $\in$ C(A). In words, if *x* is revealed preferred to *y* and *y* is in the choice of *A* then *x* will also be in that choice too.

- **Utility preference**: $\forall$ x,y $\in$ X, x $\succeq$ y $\iff$ u(x) $\geq$ u(y). 

- **Debreu's Theorem**: if X is a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $\succeq$ is complete, transitive and continuous $\iff$ it has a representation by a continuous utility function. Proof sketch on slides 29-30.

- **Continuous**: upper and lower contour sets $\{ y \in X: y \succeq x \}$ and $\{ y \in X: x \succeq y \}$ are closed. 

- **Ordinal Utility**: if *u* represents $\succeq$, it is also represented by v $\iff$ there is a strictly increasing function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ s.t. v = f $\circ$ u. In this sense, utility is **ordinal**: only the ordering matters (size matters not).

- **Continuous Revealed Preference Theory**: X = $\mathbb{R}^n_+$ free disposal menus equal budget sets. The data satisfies GARP. 

- **Afriat's Theorem**: if D is finite then the data satisfies GARP $\iff$ it can be generated by a continuou, concave, strictly increasing utility function.

#### **Proofs**

- Arrow 1959.

- Proof of utility representation: suppose $X$ is finite, then there is a utility function that represents $\succeq$ $\iff$ $\succeq$ is complete and transitive.

- Proof of Debreu 1954: slides 29-30.

### **L2**

#### **Testing Revealed Preference Theory I, Methodology**

- **Rationalizable**: If choice probabilities can be generated by some v$\in$(U) then it's rationalizable. This means that if (P,X) is rationalizable for any x $\in$ X if x $\in$ A and A $\subseteq$ A' then P$_A$(x) $\geq$ P$_{A'}$(x). In words, if we give a larger choice set then choice probability/market shares of the originally available items cannot increase.

- **Decoy Effect**: adding a "decoy" into a choice menu, a decoy that is dominated by one alternative but not by the other, can lead to violations of regularity and implies violations of WARP. For example, people might buy more US\$100 items when a US\$200 is added, instead of the US\$ 50 one. 

- **Bernoulli Utility**: any function $u: Z \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. 

- **Expected utility representation**: if there is a Bernoulli utility function *u* such that $U(p) = \sum_{z \in Z}p(z)u(z)$ represents $\succeq$. 

- **Independence Axiom**: $\forall$ p,q,r, $\in \Delta$(Z) and $\alpha \in (0,]$ we have that $p \succeq q$ implies $\alpha p + (1 - \alpha) r \succ$ $\alpha q + (1 - \alpha) r$). Regardless of the weight you assign to r, the first option will always be preferred. 

- **Consequentialism**: when nature rules out *r*, agent makes the same choice between *p* and *q*.

- **Dynamic consistency**: the agent makes same decisions in the 2 choice problems.

- **Dirac measure**: lotteries $\delta_z$ that surely gives *z* with probability 1.

- **Cardinal Uniqueness**: given 2 Bernoulli utility functions: *u* and *u'*, there is $a > 0$ and $b$ such that $\forall z \in Z$, u(z) = au'(z) + b and all such a,b give equivalent representations(unique up to affine transformations). Adding a constant or multiplying by some factor (as long as $a > 0$) to the utility of all outcomes won't change the ranking itself.

- **Jensen's Inequality**: an expected utility preference is risk averse/risk neutral/risk loving if *u* is concave/affine/convex.

- **CARA**(coefficient of absolute risk aversion): A(z) = $\frac{-u''(z)}{u'(z)}$.

#### **Proofs**:

- **von-Neumann Preferences**: preference $\succeq$ on $\Delta(Z)$ has an expected utility representation $\iff$ it's complete, transitive, continuous and has the independence axiom.

- **Cardinal uniqueness**.

### **L3**

#### **Lotteries with Monetary Payoffs**

- **Coefficient of Relative Risk Version**: R(w) = $\frac{-wu''(w)}{u'(w)}$ = an agent with increasing relative risk aversion gets more averse to proportional risks as he gets wealthier.

- **Insurance against a purely monetary loss**. Optimal purchase of actuarially fair insurance only *equates the marginal utility* in the various states.

- **Insurance with state dependent utility**.

- **Risk preferences of insurances in the lab**: Given the wealth of most lab subjects, they
should be almost risk neutral to lab gambles(given they are small stakes), but they’re not.

- **First Order Stochastic Dominance**: p ≥$^{FOSD}$ q, if $F_p(x) ≤ F_q(x)\forall x$. It doesn't necessarily let us compare the realization of lotteries but we could represent them with a perfectly correlated lotteries where one is always as large as the other. **Theorem**: p ≥$^{FOSD}$ q $\iff \int u(dp) ≥ \int u(dq)$ for every weakly increasing function u: $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

- **Second Order Stochastic Dominance**: what if we add concavity to the expected utility of lotteries? If the supports of *p* and *q* lie in [a,b]m we say *p* SOSD *q*, *p* $\succeq^{SOSD}$ *q* if $\int_a^c F_q(x)dx ≥ \int_a^c F_p(X) dx \forall c \in [a,b]$. **Theorem**: assuming $Ep$ = $Eq$, then $p \succeq^{SOSD} q \iff \forall$ nondecreasing concave $u$ on [a,b] $\int_b^a ud F_p ≥ \int_a^b udF_q$. Intuitively, this comes from a related result, where $p SOSDs q$ only if we can write $p$ and $q$ as the marginal distributions of random variables $z_p$ and $z_q$ with $z_q = z_p + \epsilon$ and E($\epsilon | z_p$) ≤ 0.

#### Proofs

- **FOSD**: p ≥$^{FOSD} q \iff \int u(dp) ≥ \int u(dq)$ for every weakly increasing function u: $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

### **L4**

#### **Non-EU Risk Preferences**

- **The Allais Paradox**: choice questions that violates expected utility.

    - A: $1 \delta_1$ vs B $0.1 \delta_5 + 0.89 \delta_1 + 0.01 \delta_0$. Although expected utility is higher for B, considerably lot of people choose A.
    
    - C: $0.11\delta_1 + 0.89 \delta_0$ vs D: $0.1 \delta_5 + 0.9 \delta_0$. Again although EU of C is higher, a lot choose D.
    
    - Reason: use the independence axiom - $0.11 \delta_1 + 0.89 \delta_1 \succ 0.1 \delta_5 + 0.89 \delta_1 + 0.01 \delta_0 \rightarrow \delta_1 \succ (10/11)\delta_5 + (1/11)\delta_0$. 
    
- **Prospect Theory**: Reference-dependent preferences for changes to current wealth (to ac- commodate ”loss aversion.”). Preference over lotteries non-linear in probabilities via proba- bility weighting function. One critical problem is that the prospect theory allows violations of FOSD. This leads to rank-dependent expected utility and cumulative prospect theory.

- **Cumulative Prospect Theory**: under EU, one way to compute the expected utility is using "vertical stripes" as in Riemann integrals; another is using horizontal stripes using Lebesgue integration. CPT is like integrating the horizontal stripes, replacing *p* with $\pi(p)$ and this gives preferences tht follow FOSD. CPT has been used to explain a wide range of lab data, including why some people both buy insurance and lottery tickets.
