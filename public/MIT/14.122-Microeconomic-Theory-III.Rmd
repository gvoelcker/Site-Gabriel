### **L1** 

#### **Static Deterministic Choice and Revealed Preference**

- **Completeness**: for every set of alternatives(menus) X: agents know whether they prefer *x* or *y*. 

- **Transitive**: given *x*, *y* and *z*, if $x \succeq y$ and $y \succeq z$, then $x \succeq z$.

- **Anti-symmetric**: if $x \succeq y$ and $y \succeq x$, then *x* = *y*. 
- **Choice correspondence**: a map c:M(X) $\rightarrow$ M(X) s.t. c(A) $\subseteq) A. c(A) gives the alternatives chosen when presented with menu A.

- **WARP**: if A,B $\in M$ and *x,y* $\in$ A $\cap$ B, $x \in C(A)$ and $y \in C(B)$ $\implies x \in C(B)$. In words, this means: 

    - WARP: implies Sen's $\alpha$: if $x \in A \subseteq B$ and $x \in C(B)$ $\implies$ $x \in C(A)$. 
    
    - **Weakly revealed preferred**: $\succeq^\ast$. If x $\succeq^\ast$ y $\implies$ x was chosen for any menu that contains *y*. 
    
- **Transitive closure**: when you can add terms between the relation x $\succeq^\ast$ y $\implies$ x $\succeq^\ast$ z $\succeq^\ast$ y.

- **Congruent**: if x $\succeq^\ast$ y and y $\in$ C(A) then x $\in$ C(A). In words, if *x* is revealed preferred to *y* and *y* is in the choice of *A* then *x* will also be in that choice too.

- **Utility preference**: $\forall$ x,y $\in$ X, x $\succeq$ y $\iff$ u(x) $\geq$ u(y). 

- **Debreu's Theorem**: if X is a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $\succeq$ is complete, transitive and continuous $\iff$ it has a representation by a continuous utility function. Proof sketch on slides 29-30.

- **Continuous**: upper and lower contour sets $\{ y \in X: y \succeq x \}$ and $\{ y \in X: x \succeq y \}$ are closed. 

- **Ordinal Utility**: if *u* represents $\succeq$, it is also represented by v $\iff$ there is a strictly increasing function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ s.t. v = f $\circ$ u. In this sense, utility is **ordinal**: only the ordering matters (size matters not).

- **Continuous Revealed Preference Theory**: X = $\mathbb{R}^n_+$ free disposal menus equal budget sets. The data satisfies GARP. 

- **Afriat's Theorem**: if D is finite then the data satisfies GARP $\iff$ it can be generated by a continuou, concave, strictly increasing utility function.

#### **Proofs**

- Arrow 1959.

- Proof of utility representation: suppose $X$ is finite, then there is a utility function that represents $\succeq$ $\iff$ $\succeq$ is complete and transitive.

- Proof of Debreu 1954: slides 29-30.

### **L2**

#### **Testing Revealed Preference Theory I, Methodology**

- **Rationalizable**: If choice probabilities can be generated by some v$\in$(U) then it's rationalizable. This means that if (P,X) is rationalizable for any x $\in$ X if x $\in$ A and A $\subseteq$ A' then P$_A$(x) $\geq$ P$_{A'}$(x). In words, if we give a larger choice set then choice probability/market shares of the originally available items cannot increase.

- **Decoy Effect**: adding a "decoy" into a choice menu, a decoy that is dominated by one alternative but not by the other, can lead to violations of regularity and implies violations of WARP. For example, people might buy more US\$100 items when a US\$200 is added, instead of the US\$ 50 one. 

- **Bernoulli Utility**: any function $u: Z \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. 

- **Expected utility representation**: if there is a Bernoulli utility function *u* such that $U(p) = \sum_{z \in Z}p(z)u(z)$ represents $\succeq$. 

- **Independence Axiom**: $\forall$ p,q,r, $\in \Delta$(Z) and $\alpha \in (0,]$ we have that $p \succeq q$ implies $\alpha p + (1 - \alpha) r \succ$ $\alpha q + (1 - \alpha) r$). Regardless of the weight you assign to r, the first option will always be preferred. 

- **Consequentialism**: when nature rules out *r*, agent makes the same choice between *p* and *q*.

- **Dynamic consistency**: the agent makes same decisions in the 2 choice problems.

- **Dirac measure**: lotteries $\delta_z$ that surely gives *z* with probability 1.

- **Cardinal Uniqueness**: given 2 Bernoulli utility functions: *u* and *u'*, there is $a > 0$ and $b$ such that $\forall z \in Z$, u(z) = au'(z) + b and all such a,b give equivalent representations(unique up to affine transformations). Adding a constant or multiplying by some factor (as long as $a > 0$) to the utility of all outcomes won't change the ranking itself.

- **Jensen's Inequality**: an expected utility preference is risk averse/risk neutral/risk loving if *u* is concave/affine/convex.

- **CARA**(coefficient of absolute risk aversion): A(z) = $\frac{-u''(z)}{u'(z)}$.

#### **Proofs**:

- **von-Neumann Preferences**: preference $\succeq$ on $\Delta(Z)$ has an expected utility representation $\iff$ it's complete, transitive, continuous and has the independence axiom.

- **Cardinal uniqueness**.
