### **Paper Analysis**

-   **Research question**:  what are the determinants and outcomes of renegotiation of debt contracts?

-   **Intended contribution/importance**: provides novel empirical evidence on renegotiation, its determinants and its implications for financial contracting. 

-   **Hypotheses**: 

-   **Setting/research design**: 1000 private credit agreements between 1996 and 2005. 1st test: Probit: how much more likely is a firm to renegotiate given some ex ante and ex post conditions..........? 2nd test: Multinomial logit: what determines the outcomes?

-   **Main results**: primary determinants of renegotiation and outcomes: new information concerning credit quality, investment opportunities, collateral of the borrower and macroeconomic fluctuations.

-   **Additional results crucial to the story**: ex ante contingencies help shape renegotiation outcomes through their effect on the default outcome and the allocation of bargaining power $\implies$ optimal allocation of bargaining power between contracting parties.

- **Possible alternative hypotheses**: 

-   **Conclusion**:  optimal contract design should appropriately allocate bargaining power in different future states of the world to maximize relationship-specific investments. 

- **Future research**: what are implications of frequent renegotiation for our understanding of debt maturity? Which contracts are to be altered during renegotiation? What are ex ante and ex post efficiency implications of renegotiations? 

### **When evaluating a paper:**

- Does the study address an important question?

- Does the study extend prior literature?

- Is the study's conceptual framework logically consistent and credible?

- Are the sample, proxies, and empirical models appropriate?

- Does the study consider and rule out alternative explanations?

### **Summary**

The paper analyze **renegotiations** of private loans. Renegotiations happen frequently, and they lead to significant changes to the terms of the contract. They are affected by: **new information regarding credit quality**, **investment opportunities** and **collateral** of the borrowers. The **macroeconomic** environment also plays a large role in shaping renegotiation. They also present a **cyclical pattern**. 

The first **test** is about the determinants of renegotiation and its outcomes: how does the \% of probability of a renegotiation varies with the impact of the variables? We look at ex-post changes and ex-ante determinants. Very little about the contracting environment at origination is relevant for predicting future renegotiations. The second **test** uses a multinomial logit to measure the outcome of the renegotiation.

Conclusion: Contingencies in the ex ante contract help shape renegotiation outcomes through their effect on the default outcome and the allocation of bargaining power.

- 90\% of long-term debt contracts are renegotiated prior to their maturity.

- Four possible outcomes for each loan: renegotiated, matured, disappeared, end of sample. 

- Pricing grid: makes the interest spread on outstanding borrowings a function of inancial ratios or credit ratings.
