### **Paper Analysis**

-   **Research question**: do syndicated loans securitized through collateralized loan obligations(**CLOs**) have more standardized financial covenants?

-   **Intended contribution/importance**: 1) to research on the differences between securitized and institutional syndicated loans, by showing that securitized loans have more standardized covenants and that the costs of collecting and processing information related to CLO portfolio monitoring and screening are related with the presence of standardized covenants; 2) to the literature on CLOs' loan investment decisions: by purchasing loans with standardized covenant specifications, CLOS trade off loan features of better monitoring to decrease the high information costs that arise from their business models; 3) expand on the literature of the determinants of the structure of covenant packages that improve contracting efficiency.  

-   **Hypotheses**: securitized loans have more standardized financial constraints to customized borrower-specific covenants as those constraints are likely to help CLOs screen and monitor their portfolios in a more efficient way. This leads to less precise default signals but CLOs are willing to let go of this precision to balance their high information costs associated with the monitoring and screening of their loan portfolio.

-   **Setting/research design**: 3,303 complete financial covenant definitions in 440 securitized and 703 nonsecuritized high-yield loan contracts. Textual analysis of plagiarism to measure covenant standardization. 

-   **Main results**: securitized loans $\leftarrow \rightarrow$ $\uparrow$ standardization of covenants. 

-   **Additional results crucial to the story**: when the collateral loan obligations are more diverse or frequently rebalanced portfolios are more likely to purchase loans with standardized covenants, potentially because standardization alleviates information processing costs related to loan monitoring and screening. Covenant standardization is associated with greater loan and CLO note rating agreement between credit rating agencies, further supporting the relation between lower information costs and covenant standardization. 

- **Possible alternative hypotheses**: 1) given we don't observe loan term sheets with covenant specifications before and after a CLO joins a loan syndicate, it is possible that an unobservable correlated omitted variable determines both CLO ownership of a loan and covenant standardization; 2) CLOs may rely in other monitoring schemes, they may simply ignore the covenants; 3) can't draw inferences on whether standardized covenants provide more or less credit protection to lenders relative to customized covenants.

-   **Conclusion**: loan securitization is related to the design of standardized financial covenants.

- **Future research**: relation between securitization and covenant standardization are potentially interesting future research avenues.

### **When evaluating a paper:**

- Does the study address an important question?

- Does the study extend prior literature?

- Is the study's conceptual framework logically consistent and credible?

- Are the sample, proxies, and empirical models appropriate?

- Does the study consider and rule out alternative explanations?

### **Summary**

Sum: Using a hand-collected set of financial covenant definitions, we study whether loans securitized through CLOs are associated with more standardized financial covenant specifications. We expect that covenant standardization is one of the possible mechanisms that CLOs likely employ to alleviate high information costs related to the monitoring and screening of their portfolio loans. Borrowing from the field of computational linguistics, we apply a vector space model to proxy for covenant standardization using the textual similarity of financial covenant definitions.

- What are securitized loans? Securitization is a process by which various types of contractual debt are pooled together and consolidated as bonds, pass through securities, or collateralized debt obligations (CDO) to investors also called Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS). 

- Investigates whether syndicated loans securitized through collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) have more homogenous and comparable (standardized) financial covenants.

- In the preceding 15 years, collateralized loan obligations have become the dominant institutional investor in syndicated loans(70\% market share).

- Given CLOs have a large and diversified portfolio, they're less worried about a borrower-specific exposure. They assume that diversification deals with the idiosyncratic risk. 1) Standardized covenants help CLOs to alleviate the high information costs from portfolio diversification while still providing a default signal that supports monitoring activities. 2) as CLOs rebalance their portfolios on a **monthly basis**, customization leads to higher screening costs. 3) customized constrains lead to more disagreements between credit rating agencies that rate CLO loans and notes $\implies$ increases CLOs costs.  

- CLO characteristics that drives their behavior (2.1): 1) Diversification of investments; 2) Active monitoring; 3) Results reported to investors.
