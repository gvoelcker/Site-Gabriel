# [**The Impact of State-Level R&D Tax Credits On The Quantity And Quality Of Entrepreneurship**]()

## {.tabset}

### **Paper Analysis**

-   **Research question**: what is the effects of R\&D tax credit on the rate of formation and growth potential of new businesses?

-   **Intended contribution/importance**: provide evidence on the causal relation of R\&D tax credit in on the quantity, quality and performance of entrepreneurship. There has been no paper that directly observes the overall impact of the R\&D tax credit on the rate, nature and scaling of new businesses.

-   **Hypotheses**: 

-   **Setting/research design**: diff-in-diff estimate of the impact of the R\&D tax credit on the quantity and quality-adjusted quantity of entrepreneurship. 30,093 observations merging the Startup Cartography Project and PDIT. 

-   **Main results**: R\&D tax credit is associated with a significant long-term impact on both the quantity and quality of entrepreneurship, with the biggest materialization happening 5 years after the policy is enacted.

-   **Additional results crucial to the story**: provide evidence on the potential of the R\&D fiscal policy to stimulate the formation of growth-oriented start-ups.

- **Possible alternative hypotheses**: investment tax credits retard the form of entrepreneurship needed for economic growth.

-   **Conclusion**: the results are informative for policy design. Though initially aimed at fostering innovation by established enterprises, state R&D tax credits also increase the rate of entrepreneurship, and importantly, the formation of high growth potential startups needed to achieve economic development objectives.

- **Future research**:  

### **When evaluating a paper:**

- Does the study address an important question?

- Does the study extend prior literature?

- Is the study's conceptual framework logically consistent and credible?

- Are the sample, proxies, and empirical models appropriate?

- Does the study consider and rule out alternative explanations?

### **Summary**

Assessing the role of policy on entrepreneurship depends on evaluating not only its impact in terms of the number of new companies founded, but also on its potential for generating and increasing the realization of meaningful growth outcomes

- **Motivation for tax policies**: (1) to spur investment in innovation by larger and more established companies (their original intended purpose); and (2) to encourage the formation of growth-oriented ventures and accelerate their performance.

- **Contribution**: While an extensive literature investigates the impact of R&D tax credits on innovation, and another complementary literature considers how taxes broadly effect entry into entrepreneurship, there appears to be a lack of evidence on the question at the intersection of the two: how R&D fiscal incentives change the local production of entrepreneurship in those locations that adopt them.

- **Method**: how do we identify whether state R\&D tax credits are generating the formation and accelerating the performance of the types of startups that have the potential for exponential growth? We overcome this impasse by extending our earlier work (Guzman & Stern, 2016) to leverage a *novel dataset on tax incentives* (Bartik, 2017). Building on the methodology of Guzman and Stern (2016), **we combine business registration records and predictive analytics to leverage founding choices that signal growth intention and model the relationship of these choices to later growth outcomes**. We use this mapping to prospectively account for **differences in the growth potential (or quality) of startups at or near the time of founding and develop systematic measures of the quantity, quality-adjusted quantity, and scaling potential of entrepreneurship in a region** (Guzman & Stern, 2015, 2016, 2017). **We then consider the respective interactions of those measures with the availability (or absence) of state-level R&D tax credits**.
