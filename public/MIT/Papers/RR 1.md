# [**The Treatment of Accounting Changes in Covenants and Debt Contracting Efficiency**]()

## {.tabset}

### **Paper Analysis**

-   **Research question**: is **frozen-on-request GAAP** more useful in promoting debt contracting efficiency?

-   **Intended contribution/importance**: provides new evidence on the role of accounting standards in improving debt contracting efficiency as there isn't much research on frozen-on-request GAAP. 

-   **Hypotheses**: 

-   **Setting/research design**: 18,923 private debt contracts from EDGAR - 1994-2017. Debt contracting efficiency definition: minimizes errors due to false alarms and missed early warnings. Two proxies for DCE: i) **false positives** - covenant violations occur when borrowers' creditworthiness does not deteriorate below the original intent of thresholds; ii) **false negatives**: covenant violations do not occur when borrowers' creditworthiness deteriorates below the original intent of thresholds.

-   **Main results**: frozen-on-request is the most widely-used one.

-   **Additional results crucial to the story**:

- **Possible alternative hypotheses**: 

-   **Conclusion**: 

- **Future research**:  

### **When evaluating a paper:**

- Does the study address an important question?

- Does the study extend prior literature?

- Is the study's conceptual framework logically consistent and credible?

- Are the sample, proxies, and empirical models appropriate?

- Does the study consider and rule out alternative explanations?

### **Summary**

- GAAP keeps evolving $\implies$ this evolution could affect covenant calculations and thereby affect borrowers' complicance with covenant and control right allocations. To **address** the impact of GAAP changes on accounting-based covenants, there are 3 types of GAAP provisions that are used to treat accounting changes:

1) **Frozen GAAP**: the borrower applies GAAP in effect on the closing date of the contract throughout the term. Pro: reduces the risk underlying the GAAP changes; con: restricts the potential benefits of improved new GAAP. 

2) **Floating GAAP**: incorporates future GAAP changes into covenants. Pro: incorporates benefits of improved new GAAP; con: may worsen contract if new GAAP changes hinder the covenants' ability to capture the state of nature 

3) **Frozen-on-request GAAP**: floating GAAP is used until the borrower/lender request change. $\uparrow$ flexibility. 

False positive: you violate but creditworthiness is above the original threshold - false alarm. Request-on-frozen by borrower.

False negative: you don't violate but creditworthiness is below the original threshold - undue optimism. Request-on-frozen by lender.

Frozen-on-request GAAP reduces false positive and negatives. 

When there are changes to accounting standards -> F-o-R GAAP has advantages.
