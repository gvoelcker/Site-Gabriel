### **Paper Analysis**

-   **Research question**: is the decline in the use of balance sheet-based covenants in private debt contracts due to the change in accounting standards?

- **Intended contribution/importance**: prior little evidence on the impact of the ongoing shift to the balance sheet approach on the qualities of accounting information. 

-   **Hypotheses**: H1 - borrowers subject to more and larger balance sheet adjustments have fewer balance sheet-based debt covenants. The shift towards a balance sheet approach has made the balance sheet less useful for contracting. $\uparrow$ balance sheet adjustments $\leftarrow \rightarrow$ $\downarrow$ $\exists$ balance sheet covenant. So many adjustments to the balance sheet end up making it less useful for contracting.

-   **Setting/research design**: 8,527 private debt agreements issued between 1996 and 2007 on LPS/Dealscan. Accounting data from Compustat, matched with "Deal Active Date". Uses **Volatility Ratio** to measure the borrower-specific exposure to balance sheet-based accounting rules. Examine six categories of financial covenants, first 2 are income statement based: **1) interest coverage** : $\frac{Earnings}{\text{Interst expense}}$; **2) Fixed charge coverage**: ratio of earnings to various changes such as interest expense, principal payments, capital expenditures, taxes, dividends...; 3 balance sheet-based: **3) Leverage**: total net assets (debt/assets); **4)** Net Worth: assets minus liabilities (all assets or only tangible); **5) Current Ratio**: $\frac{\text{Short-term assets}}{\text{Short-term liabilities}}$; **6) Debt-to-earnings**: $\frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Earnings}}$

-   **Main results**: borrowers with greater volatility ratios are less likely to have balance sheet-based covenants. $\uparrow$ VR $\iff$ $\downarrow$ inclusion of balance sheet covenants. Doesn't find significant relation between vR and income statement covenants. **Balance sheet information has become less useful** for the debt contracting parties.

- **Additional results crucial to the story**: **1)** asset bases of borrowers are associated with covenant use(more assets and fewer operating leases $\rightarrow$ $\uparrow$ balance sheet covenants). **2)** deals with an "institutional tranche" are less likely to have balance sheet covenants. 1 + 2 $\implies$ changes in syndicated loan market have affected covenant use. Association between increased competition in lending and covenant use: covenant loosening by lenders who most agressively expanded market share but competition has not contributed to the change in use of BS covenants. 

- **Possible alternative hypotheses**: what else could be driving down the use of Balance Sheet covenants?

-   **Conclusion**: reductions in the contracting usefulness of the balance sheet being associated with reductions in balance sheet covenants. Although there is strong association between VR and BS covenant inclusion, there is no relation between the ratio and income statement covenant use. Reasons: **1)** "Dirty surplus" in US GAAP allows many balance sheet adjustments to temporarily avoid recognition on the income statement; **2)** when adjustments go to the income statement, earnings in debt covenants is generally modified from its GAAP definition to exclude these adjustments. 

- **Future research**: understanding the consequences and causes of reduction of useful information in balance sheets. 

### **When evaluating a paper:**

- Does the study address an important question?

- Does the study extend prior literature?

- Is the study's conceptual framework logically consistent and credible?

- Are the sample, proxies, and empirical models appropriate?

- Does the study consider and rule out alternative explanations?

### **Summary**

- I examine how the balance sheet approach, with its increase in fair value and estimated asset and liability values, has contributed to the decline in use of balance sheet covenants. Using the Volatility Ratio (VR), a proxy for exposure to balance sheet-based accounting rules, I find a negative association between the balance sheet approach and use of balance sheet covenants. There may be additional factors driving the change in covenant use, so the shift in standard setting related to the balance-sheet approach has contributed to, but is not the sole reason for the change in use of balance sheet covenants.

#### **Intro**

- Balance sheet variables: Leverage, Net Worth and Current Ratio. 1996: 80\% use $\rightarrow$ 2007: 32\% use.

- Other covenants no such decline: Income Statement variables: Interest Coverage, Fixed Charge Coverage and Debt-to-Earnings.

Change of focus: from the **income statement approach**(determining net income) to the **balance sheet approach**(valuation of assets and liabilities). Also: $\uparrow$ **fair value accounting**: recognition of financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet at the market price rather than at their historical cost. 


By using the balance sheet approach, often *estimates* of asset and liability values and *timing discretion* in reporting value changes are employed. These changes have compromised the value of the balance sheet for debt contracting. By using the *"balance sheet adjustments"* we may introduce error and bias into the reported asset and liability measures $\implies$ providing unreliable signals of the borrower's liquidation value $\implies$ lenders won't use balance sheet-based financial covenants as much. The paper hypothesizes that this trend in standard setting has contributed to the change in covenant use and that the magnitude of the balance sheet adjustments is negatively associated with the likelihood of a borrower having a balance sheet covenant.

#### **Hypothesis development**

Roles of accounting data in debt contracting:

1) information role: helps the lender to determine the **likelihood and potential cost of default**. This factors into the initial design and subsequent renegotiation of the loan. (not focus of this paper)
    
2) direct contracting role: provisions such as financial covenants or performance pricing being written directly on accounting variables. **If the contracting usefulness of a piece of information is sufficiently reduced** $\rightarrow$ **it will no longer be used in debt contracts**. 

#### **3.1**

Table 1: Firms are using less balance sheet-based covenants. 

#### **3.2**

Firms more subject to balance sheet-based accounting rules, either through their industry, business, or investment opportunity set, are less likely to have balance sheet covenants in their loans. Caveat: 1) what is the best way to measure the expected frequency and magnitude of the adjustments? 2) Compustat's limitation: difficult to separate balance sheet adjustments from non-adjustment items. 

Measure of balance sheet focus: **Volatility Ratio**: $VR = \frac{\text{Book Value Volatility}}{\text{Adjusted Net Income Volatility}}$. This formulation allows the ratio to measure adjustments controlling for the ongoing operations $\implies$ adjustments can be part of other income or dirty surplus, but not from adjusted net income. VR, although a noisy measure, is more closely associated with adjustments than with non-adjustment items. 

#### **4.2**

In addition to testing VR and covenant inclusion relation, **3 alternative explanations are tested**: 1) change in borrower asset base; 2) use of operating leases; 3) changes in the syndicated loan market.

#### **4.3**

When a firm changes the level of balance sheet covenant protection from one deal to the next, this change is associated with the extent of balance sheet focus in their reporting.
