### **Paper Analysis**

-   **Research question**: what's the probability that a borrower will violate financial covenants in private debt contracts?

-   **Intended contribution/importance**: builds on prior literature to develop a better measure of covenant violation probability. It includes more covenant categories, uses covenant-specific definitions that minimize measurement error, and uses a nonparametric estimation approach. Provide detailed analysis of how financial covenants are measured in practice, allowing to identify "standard" definitions that minimize measurement error.

-   **Hypotheses**: 

-   **Setting/research design**: uses hand-coded sample of loans for which actual covenant definitions are available to determine the best definition for each covenant category. Uses the Tearsheet database. Sample: 2,100 loans from 1987 to 2004.

-   **Main results**: generates an aggregate probability of violation. This measure outperforms the others in prior literature. 

-   **Additional results crucial to the story**: For nearly all of the Dealscan covenant categories, the average error in computing probability of individual covenant violation using our standard definition vs the actual contractually specified definitions is insignificant. 

- **Possible alternative hypotheses/limitations**: using in smaller settings/subsamples. If covenant definitions change, their work should be revisited.

-   **Conclusion**: 

- **Future research**:  

### **When evaluating a paper:**

- Does the study address an important question?

- Does the study extend prior literature?

- Is the study's conceptual framework logically consistent and credible?

- Are the sample, proxies, and empirical models appropriate?

- Does the study consider and rule out alternative explanations?
