## Credit Market Disruptions and Liquidity Spillover Effects in The Supply Chain{.tabset}

### Paper Analysis

-   **Research question**: how do shocks to the banking sector travel trough the corporate economy?

-   **Why is it relevant**: important to consider whether banking sector shocks can have *spillover* effects that ripple through the corporate economy. Trade credit may have been affected, huge for intermediate goods transaction.

-   **Intended contribution**: i) to document a liquidity spillover effect from a constrained supplier to his downstream customer; ii) to provide some preliminary evidence on the trade credit channel versus other liquidity spillover channels; and iii) to quantify any adverse consequences for downstream firms. Contributions: a) provides detailed evidence on a causal mechanism that transmits financial shocks through members of a supply chain; b) economic relevance of the spillover by showing that downstream customers suffer adverse consequences; c) effects of banking sector crisis on corporate sector outcomes. To sum up: contributes to the understanding of the aggregate impact of banking sector shocks on the corporate economy + first step in identifying a causal channel for the transmission of idiosyncratic liquidity shocks.

-   **Hypotheses**: 

-   **Setting/research design**: uses a panel of monthly trade credit balances and the aging reports for each seller-buyer pair. The pairs transact **frequently**: helps identifying causal effects of a shock to th bank credit on trading behavior. Diff-in-diff approach.

-   **Main results**: suppliers exposed to a large and exogenous decline in bank financing pass this liquidity shock to their downstream customers through: 1) $\downarrow$ trade credit offered in each sale; 2) $\downarrow$ total supply of goods and services. Consequences of the spillover: customers show a spike in credit risk and a reduction in employment. 

-   **Additional results crucial to the story**:

- **Possible alternative hypotheses**: results may be driven by another channel: *sales channel*. Evidence: treatment group first cuts trade credit, then there is a decrease in total sales.

-   **Conclusion**: 

- **Future research**:  

### When evaluating a paper:

- Does the study address an important question?

- Does the study extend prior literature?

- Is the study's conceptual framework logically consistent and credible?

- Are the sample, proxies, and empirical models appropriate?

- Does the study consider and rule out alternative explanations?

### Summary

Paper finds that the adverse spillover effects happen through 2 channels: a) trade credit channel; b) sales channel. Their contributions are not separated. Rather, the paper is a first step showing that spillover effects are significant and they can occur through both of these channels, and no channel dominates the other, but the change in the credit channel happens first.
