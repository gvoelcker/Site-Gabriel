### Paper Analysis

-   **Research question**: do managers actively try to avoid debt covenant violations?

-   **Intended contribution/importance**: contribute to the debt covenant literature with an new sample that directly observes private loans and measure the closeness to debt covenants in private debt agreements.

-   **Hypotheses**: do accounting managers make accounting choices that reduce likelihood of violating debt covenants? 

-   **Setting/research design**: Dealscan uses private loans data(30,000 obs) to construct precise measures of closeness to debt covenants in private debt agreements. 

-   **Main results**: clear support for debt covenant hypothesis: unusually small number of firm/quarters with financial measures just below covennat thresholds and an unusually large firms that just meet/beat thresholds. Private lenders set debt covenants tightly and use them as "trip wires" for borrowers, that technical violations occur relatively often and violations are not necessarily associated with financial distress.

-   **Additional results crucial to the story**: the relative tightness of covenant restrictions and corresponding frequency of violations is inconsistent with lenders imposing serious consequences on borrowing firms. Leverage is a noisy proxy for tightness. Before the 1st violation, managers try even more actively to avoid violations.

- **Possible alternative hypotheses**: ex-ante contracting has lenders systematically placing covenant thresholds slightly below actual values? What is the form of management that leads to this result? Is it through real results or is there manipulation(assuming the goal is clear)?

- **Conclusion**: managers actively avoid debt covenant violations.

- **Future research**: how are the terms of debt covenants determined as a function of firm characteristics? Extend to other covenants?

### When evaluating a paper:

- Does the study address an important question?

- Does the study extend prior literature?

- Is the study's conceptual framework logically consistent and credible?

- Are the sample, proxies, and empirical models appropriate?

- Does the study consider and rule out alternative explanations?

### Summary

The paper sets out to test **whether managers actively try to avoid debt covenant violations**(the debt covenant hypothesis). It innovates in using Dealscan, which has a 30,000 sample of private loans that has **precise** measures of closeness to debt covenants in private debt agreements. It is reported that a unusually high number of observations just meat/beat the threshold, which indicates manipulation by the managers. 


- If managers are aware of the thresholds that when violated would lead to a debt covenant violation $\implies$ they obviously will try to avoid its violation (debt covenant hypothesis âœ… ). What are the means they use to achieve this? (who plays dirty in the short term gets worse return in the long term?)
