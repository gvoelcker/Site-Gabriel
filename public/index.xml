      <description>In 2016 I had the opportunity to take a class in my masters entitled Econophysics. Econophysics is a field of study that applies methods and theories developed by physicists to economic problems. Around that time I came across a very interesting phenomenon called Benford’s Law. This post is an introduction to Benford’s Law using RStudio. Let’s start by understanding what Benford’s Law is.
I am thinking of a number from 1 to 99.</description>

      <description>My name is Gabriel Voelcker and I am, among other things, an economist. I hope to use this netlify as a place to share my research ideas, improve my coding skills and, last but not least, connect with other people who share interests with me. Since I love telling stories, I will try to write everything in a way that you are capable of understanding. So, regardless if the person reading what I will write doesn’t have a clue what tidyverse or Cobb-Douglas is, or is a Nobel laureate(not unprecedented to be honest, but let’s save this story for another time) he or she should be able to understand what I’m trying to convey.</description>

      <description>I am an economist from Brazil. My alma mater is Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, and I graduated in 2016. I am currently finishing my masters in Accounting at Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos. My main research interests include: econometrics, microeconomics, disclosure, disclosure regulation, game theory, risk, behavioural economics, decision-making, cultural economics and dividend policy.
You can find everything I have published in my Google Scholar page, although I haven’t many contributions yet.</description>
