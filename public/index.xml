      <description>My name is Gabriel Voelcker and I am, among other things, an economist. I hope to use this netlify as a place to share my research ideas, improve my coding skills and, last but not least, connect with other people who share interests with me. Since I love telling stories, I will try make everything I write as easy to understand as possible. Unfortunately, since most of what is going to be talked about here concerns researches in accounting, economics and finance, readers outside this area of research may find it difficult to comprehend what I wirte.</description>

      <description>I am an economist from Brazil. My alma mater is Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, and I graduated in 2016. In 2018 I finished my masters in accounting and finance at Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos. My main research interests include: econometrics, microeconomics, disclosure, disclosure regulation, game theory, risk, behavioural economics, decision-making, cultural economics and dividend policy.
You can find everything I have published in my Google Scholar page, although I havenâ€™t many contributions yet.</description>
