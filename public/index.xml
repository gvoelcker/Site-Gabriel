      <description>I am thinking of a number from 1 to 99. I am giving you 2 seconds to guess which is the first digit of that number.
   So, which number did you think of? Actually, that’s irrelevant. My intention here is to make you reflect about this question: what were the odds of you correctly guessing the first digit?
First of, there are 9 possibilities(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) since 0 is never a first digit among the possibilities I’ve described.</description>

      <description>My name is Gabriel Voelcker and I am, among other things, an economist. I hope to use this netlify as a place to formalize my ideas, improve my coding skills and, last but not least, connect with other people who share interests with me.</description>

      <description>I am an economist from Brazil. My alma mater is Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, and I graduated in 2016. I am currently finishing my masters in Accounting at Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos. My main research interests include: econometrics, microeconomics, disclosure, disclosure regulation, game theory, risk, behavioural economics, decision-making, cultural economics and dividend policy.
You can find everything I have published in my Google Scholar page, although I haven’t many contributions yet.</description>
