<p>Programming skills are like the Universe: always expanding until proven otherwise. Thatâ€™s why I decided to start compiling useful material for those using R. Doing so not only will help me keep track of where the knowledge is, it may also prove to be helpful to other people. Here it goes:</p>
<div id="introductory-material" class="section level4">
<h4>Introductory Material</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>For those just starting with R, my first steps were taken using <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html"><strong>R for Data Science</strong></a>. This book covers all the basic aspects of R and stimulates the user to navigate further in programming. The solutions for the exercises in the book can be found <a href="https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/index.html"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the most useful resources of R is its plotting capabilities. For that, the package <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/"><strong>ggplot2</strong></a> is our goldmine.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are not feeling creative, <a href="https://awesome-r.com/index.html?fbclid=IwAR1tDgBHyxXX6e5YfNJIS1Eg1JsrgMLM9YaEAo0iLoR3SZb5fe4J6lIntWw"><strong>here</strong></a> are some good rpackage ideas.</p></li>
</ul>
