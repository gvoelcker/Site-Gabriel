<p>This last Monday I presented my dissertation and had the pleasure of concluding another cycle: my masters in accounting and finance. The work is entitled: “An Analysis of Risk-Taking in Family Firms”, and I was oriented by Prof. PhD. Clea B. Macagnan.</p>
<p>The main objective of the research is to empirically test whether family firms are more risk averse than non-family firms. The empirical procedures can be divided into two stages. First, I performed tests to compare the average of variables differentiating among family firms and non family firms(62.5% of the tests indicated that they behave differently). Then, I tested my hypothesis using OLS and Random Effects. The results point to a more conservative behaviour from family firms towards risk-taking.</p>
<p>I used a sample of brazilian firms, with data from 2010 to 2017, obtaining 1188 observations. There were two main sources of information that I used. The first is <a href="https://economatica.com/"><strong>Economática</strong></a>, which can be introduced as the brazilian Compustat. Almost all variables were downloaded from this software, available to me as a Unisinos student. But I also need all the information about shareholders, families and board of directors, which must be disclosed by all companies listed in the Brazilian stock market.</p>
<p>There are two ways of obtaining this information. The first is the more troublesome one: downloading all the available data at the <a href="https://cvmweb.cvm.gov.br/SWB/Sistemas/SCW/CPublica/CiaAb/FormBuscaCiaAb.aspx?TipoConsult=c"><strong>source</strong></a>. In this case, one would have to download manually for each year and each company of the desired sample.</p>
<p>Luckily, a RStudio package has been developed that quickly downloads all the available data upon setting some parameters: GetDFPData. It is possible to obtain all the data via RStudio or <a href="http://www.msperlin.com/shiny/GetDFPData/"><strong>here</strong></a>. If one is interested in obtaining data from Brazilian companies, this is the best free source of data available, in my opinion. All the information is in English.</p>
<p>I’d like to acknowledge the contributions of the examination board, which consisted of Profs. PhDs Guilherme Kirch, Cristiano Costa, Roberto Decourt and Daniel Vancin. There is still a lot to work on until this project is published but I’m happy to share for Portuguese speakers the current version of the paper <a href="https://gabrielvoelcker.netlify.com/FF_Semead.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
