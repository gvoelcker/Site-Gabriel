<p>This last Monday I presented my dissertation and had the pleasure of concluding my masters. The work is entitled: “An Analysis of Risk-Taking in Family Firms”, and was oriented by Prof. PhD. Clea B. Macagnan.</p>
<p>The main objective of the research is to empirically test whether family firms are more risk averse than non-family firms. I used a sample of brazilian firms, with data from 2010 to 2017, obtaining 1188 observations. I can divide the empirical procedures in two stages. First, I performed tests to compare the average of variables differentiating among family firms and non family firms(62.5% of the tests indicated that they behave differently). Then, I tested my hypothesis using OLS and Random Effects. The results point to a more conservative behaviour from family firms towards risk-taking.</p>
<p>I’d like to acknowledge the contributions of the examination board, which consisted of Profs. PhDs Guilherme Kirch, Cristiano Costa, Roberto Decourt and Daniel Vancin. There is still a lot to work on until this project is published but I’m happy to share for Portuguese speakers the current version of the paper <a href="https://gabrielvoelcker.netlify.com/FF_Semead.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
