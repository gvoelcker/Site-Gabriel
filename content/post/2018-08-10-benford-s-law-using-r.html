<p>I am thinking of a number from 1 to 99. I am giving you 2 seconds to guess which is the first <strong>digit</strong> of that number.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>So, which number did you think of? Actually, that’s irrelevant. My intention here is to make you reflect about this question: what were the odds of you correctly guessing the first digit?</p>
<p>First of, there are 9 possibilities(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) since 0 is never a first digit among the possibilities I’ve described. So, if you chose 4, there were 11/99 = 1/9 =~ 11% of chances that you guessed correctly, right? So far, simple math. This is illustrated by the figure below.</p>
<p>INCLUDE 1/9 DISTRIBUTION HERE</p>
<p>But let me ask you now about a different set of numbers: 2<sup>n</sup>. Suppose, the first digit of all the powers of 2 from 1 to 1000. (2, 4, 8, 16, 32…). Would you say that by choosing 4 the odds of guessing correctly would remain 1/9? The answer is no! But the issue here is why? What drives that? Thanks to two gentlemen, Simon Newcomb and Frank Benford, we have something to say about that. In <a href="http://gerry.lamost.org/upload/newcomb.pdf"><strong>1881</strong></a>, Simon Newcomb noticed that the first pages of a logarithm book were usually more worned out than the later ones. From this, he derived his intuition that given a list of arbitrary numbers more numbers will tend to begin with an “1” than any other digit.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t until <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/984802?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"><strong>1938</strong></a> that Frank Benford formalized this discovery, which is now called Benford’s Law.</p>
