I am thinking of a number from 1 to 99. I am giving you 2 seconds to guess which is the first digit of that number. 
1.
2.
So, which number did you think of? Actually, that's irrelevant. My intention is to ask you: what were the odds of you correctly guessing the first digit? First of, there are 9 possibilities(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) since 0 is never a first digit among the possibilities I've described. Well, there are 11/99 = 1/9 =~ 11% of chances that you guessed correctly.
