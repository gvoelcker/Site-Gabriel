<p>This post is a mock post, just a test. It’s objective is to understand which stats drive the success of a team in the NBA. The data used is from the 2016-2017 NBA Regular Season and the main proxy for success is the winning percentage.</p>
<p>For example, if we compare W% and EFG:</p>

<p>Of course, that outlier on top right of the plot is the Golden State Warriors. Let’s name them?</p>
