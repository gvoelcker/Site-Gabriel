<p>My name is Gabriel Voelcker and I am, among other things, an economist. I hope to use this netlify as a place to share my research ideas, improve my coding skills and, last but not least, connect with other people who share interests with me. Since I love telling stories, I will try make everything I write as easy to understand as possible. Unfortunately, since most of what is going to be talked about here concerns researches in accounting, economics and finance, readers outside of this area of research may find it difficult to comprehend. Don’t despair! My email is below and my twitter is above, a click away.</p>
<p>This website is 100% written in RStudio. I’ve started using R recently, having used only Stata and Gretl in my undergraduate econometrics. You are welcome to see the code behind this website <a href="https://github.com/gvoelcker/Site-Gabriel"><strong>here</strong></a>. I’ve chosen this language of coding not only because it’s suits me best, but also because of its broad applicability.</p>
