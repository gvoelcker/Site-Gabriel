<p>My name is Gabriel Voelcker and I am, among other things, an economist. I hope to use this netlify as a place to share my research ideas, improve my coding skills and, last but not least, connect with other people who share interests with me. Since I love telling stories, I will try to write everything in a way that you are capable of understanding. So, regardless if the person reading what I will write doesn’t have a clue what tidyverse or Cobb-Douglas is, or is a Nobel laureate(not unprecedented to be honest, but let’s save this story for another time) he or she should be able to understand what I’m trying to convey.</p>
<p>This website is 100% written in RStudio. I’ve started using R recently, having used only Stata and Gretl in my undergraduate econometrics. You are welcome to see the code behind this website <a href="https://github.com/gvoelcker/Site-Gabriel"><strong>here</strong></a>. I’ve chosen this language of coding not only because it’s suits me best, but also because of its broad applicability.</p>
